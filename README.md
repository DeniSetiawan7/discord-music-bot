# Project - Discord.js [in3d-discord-bot] (Still in Development)
I made this bot by myself and some help from youtube, google, discord forum. so all the credits not all belongs to me.

## Getting Started
to use my discord bot u need to install node.js (cause I'm using npm),and then in your terminal you just need to clone it first.

### Installing
- First Step, **in your terminal**
```
git clone https://github.com/DeniSetiawan7/in3d-discord-bot.git
```
- Second Step, **in your terminal** (u need to move to your bot directory), and type
```
npm install
```
- Third Step, Open config.json and update all of it with your own discord bot token
```
{
	"bot": {
		"token": "",
		"owner_id": "",
		"owner_name": "",
		"prefix": ""
	},
	"serverStatus": {
		"guild_id": "",
		"total_users_id": "",
		"total_bots_id": ""
	}
}
```
- Last Step, run in cmd/terminal again
```
node server.js
```
--- DONE ---
